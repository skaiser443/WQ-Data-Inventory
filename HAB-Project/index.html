	  <h1> HAB Monitoring Locations </h1>
	  <p class = "body-text">Cyanobacteria, also known as Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), are overgrowths of algae in waterbodies. 
	     Under favorable conditions, these algae can release toxins that are harmful to the environment and 
	     living creatures, including human beings. They are also responsible for creating dead zones in waterbodies, 
	     which can have negative impacts on aquatic life and environment. As algal toxins have human health implications, 
         they need to be removed from the drinking water. This in turn can raise treatment costs. There are many factors 
	     that contribute to the growth of HABs. While HABs occur naturally in waters, they are exacerbated by overfeeding 
	     of nutrients (Nitrogen and phosphorus) resulting from human activities. Climate change is expected to bring about 
	     warmer temperatures. This can add to the problem. The main possible avenues for human exposure to HABs is either 
	     through direct contact during recreational activities or by ingestion of contaminated drinking water.<br></br>
	     This map displays locations in the Potomac basin where Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB) are being monitored. Some of these 
	     locations are long term monitoring sites while others are response based. To obtain more information, please place 
	     the mouse over the individual monitoring locations. The complete dataset can also be downloaded as an <a href = "\HAB\CynotoxinMonitoring.xlsx">Excel Spreadsheet</a>.</p>
